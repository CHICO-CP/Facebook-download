# Facebook Video Downloader

This script allows you to download videos from Facebook using the `yt_dlp` tool. It is easy to use and requires only a few steps to set up and execute.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) and `pip` installed. This script will also automatically install `yt_dlp` if it is not already present.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the script file:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebook-video-downloader.git
   cd facebook-video-downloader
   ```
Or simply download the facebook_video_downloader.py file.

**2. Install the necessary dependencies:**

If you do not have yt_dlp installed, the script will take care of installing it automatically. If you wish to do it manually, you can run:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```


**Usage**

1. Run the script:
```bash
python facebook_video_downloader.py
```

**2. Enter the Facebook video URL:**

When prompted, enter the URL of the video you want to download.


**3. Choose the download location:**

The videos will be saved in the directory /storage/emulated/0/Facebook-download/Videos. Ensure this directory exists, or the script will create it automatically.


**4. Wait for the download to finish:**

The progress of the download will be displayed in the console. Once completed, you will see a confirmation message.



**Example**

Enter the Facebook video URL: https://www.facebook.com/video-url
